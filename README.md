# ee-tic-tac-toe-agents-experimental-work
## Overview
This repository contains the experimental work that I will carry out as part of my Extended Essay (EE) in Computer Science for my IB Diploma. This work will be centred around measuring the computational performance (via time and space complexity) and decision quality (via win rates) of different agents that are solving the game tree of Tic-Tac-Toe. My research question is:

>***"To what extent does the search depth impact the computational performance and decision quality of different game-playing agents in Tic-Tac-Toe?"***
