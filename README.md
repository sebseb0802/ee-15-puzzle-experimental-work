# ee-tram-network-graph
## Overview
This repository contains the experimental work that I will carry out as part of my Extended Essay in Computer Science for my IB Diploma. This work will be centred around comparing the use of Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm on a graph representing the tram network in Vienna, Austria. This is in order to answer my research question, 

>***"To what extent is Dijkstra's algorithm more time and memory efficient than A\* algorithm when finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph representing a tram network?"***
