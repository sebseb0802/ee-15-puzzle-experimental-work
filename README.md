# ee-ski-resort-graph
## Overview
This repository contains the experimental work that I will carry out as part of my Extended Essay in Computer Science for my IB Diploma. This work will be centred around comparing the use of Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm on a graph representing the 4-Berge-Skischaukel resort in Schladming, Austria. This is in order to answer my research question, 

***"To what extent is Dijkstra's algorithm more time and memory efficient than A\* algorithm when finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph representing a ski resort?"*** 

This repository also details the construction of the graph itself from data provided by OpenStreetMap.
