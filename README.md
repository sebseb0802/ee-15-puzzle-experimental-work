# ee-15-puzzle-experimental-work
## Overview
This repository contains the experimental work that I will carry out as part of my Extended Essay (EE) in Computer Science for my IB Diploma. This work will be centred around measuring the quality of different heuristics of the A* search algorithm on a graph representing the different game states of the 15-puzzle game. My research question is:

>***"To what extent does the search depth impact the quality of different heuristics of the A\* search algorithm in solving the single-pair shortest path problem?"***
